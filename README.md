# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions to the AoC 2025 puzzles.

## Structure

I created some template files with basic setup in both Python and C++. Each day has its own directory, with code files name 1 and 2 for parts 1 and 2. In my `~/workspace/` directory I have the AtCoder library, and I've included it in my Makefile in-case I ever want to use some of its utilities.

## The Code

A lot of people use AoC as an excuse to learn a new language. This year, I'm trying to top the University of Glasgow School of Computing Science leaderboard. For that reason, I'm using C++ and Python, as those are the languages I'm the best at.

I am not planning on dedicating more time to the problems after I've solved them, and for that reason my code may be in an ugly state. I'm just doing this for the fun of solving problems and competing with my school, not to create any masterpieces.
